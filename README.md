A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for **UniFi Connect** devices, using the local UniFi Connect API. Supports the **UniFi Connect Display SE 21** and **UniFi EV Station** devices (EV Station, EV Station Pro, EV Station Lite).

## Prerequisites

This integration communicates directly with your UniFi Console over the local network. It **does not support cloud-only UniFi accounts or accounts with 2FA enabled**.

You must create a **local-only** UniFi OS account:

1. Open your UniFi Console (e.g. Dream Machine Pro).
2. Navigate to **Settings > Admins & Users > Add Admin**.
3. Select **Local Access Only**.
4. Grant **Full Management** access to UniFi Connect.
5. Use these credentials when configuring the integration.

## Supported Entities

### Display SE 21

| Platform | Entity | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Switch | Display Power | Turn the display on/off |
| Switch | Auto Rotate | Toggle automatic screen rotation |
| Switch | Auto Reload | Toggle periodic web page reload |
| Switch | Sleep Mode | Enable/disable sleep mode |
| Switch | Auto Sleep | Enable/disable automatic sleep |
| Number | Brightness | Adjust display brightness (slider) |
| Number | Volume | Adjust display volume (slider) |
| Select | Mode | Switch between Web and App mode |
| Select | App Selector | Choose which app to launch (in App mode) |
| Text | Web URL | Set the URL to display (in Web mode) |
| Button | Reload Web Page | Refresh the currently displayed web page |

### EV Station (EV Station, EV Station Pro, EV Station Lite)

| Platform | Entity | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Sensor | Charging Power | Real-time power draw (W) |
| Sensor | Charging Current | Real-time current draw (A) |
| Sensor | Voltage | Line voltage (V) |
| Sensor | Session Energy | Energy delivered in current session (Wh) |
| Sensor | Max Current | Configured current limit (A) |
| Sensor | Charge State | Current charging state (idle, charging, etc.) |
| Sensor | Total Energy Delivered | Cumulative energy across all sessions (Wh) |
| Sensor | Charge Sessions | Total number of charge sessions |
| Sensor | Last Charge Session | Energy delivered in the most recent session (Wh) |

> **Note:** EV sensors are discovered dynamically from the device shadow. The integration uses `power_stats_single` actions to request fresh real-time data each polling cycle, and fetches session history from the `/chargeHistory` endpoint. If your device exposes different field names, enable DEBUG logging for `custom_components.unifi_connect` to see the raw shadow data and [open an issue](https://github.com/danielsza/ha-unifi-connect/issues) with the output.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS > Integrations** in Home Assistant.
2. Click the menu (**⋮**) and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add this repository:
   - **URL:** `https://github.com/danielsza/ha-unifi-connect`
   - **Category:** Integration
4. Search for **UniFi Connect** and install it.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `custom_components/unifi_connect` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration**.
2. Search for **UniFi Connect**.
3. Enter your UniFi Console details:
   - **Host** - IP address or hostname of your UniFi Console
   - **Username / Password** - Local account credentials (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))
   - **Controller Type** - Select your console type (Dream Machine or Other)
   - **Port** - Defaults to `443`; only change if you use a non-standard port
4. The integration validates your credentials before completing setup.

## How It Works

- **Local polling** - The integration polls your UniFi Console every 30 seconds for device state updates. No cloud dependency.
- **Automatic re-authentication** - If the session expires, the integration re-authenticates transparently.
- **Retry on startup** - If the console is unreachable during Home Assistant startup, the integration retries automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect during setup** - Verify your console IP is reachable from the Home Assistant host and that you are using a local-only account.
- **Entities unavailable after restart** - Check that your UniFi Console is online. The integration will retry and recover automatically.
- **Check logs** - Go to **Settings > System > Logs** and filter for `unifi_connect` to see detailed error messages.

## Supported Devices

| Device | Platform ID |
|--------|-------------|
| UniFi Connect Display SE 21 | `UC-Display-SE-21` |
| UniFi EV Station | `UC-EV-Station` |
| UniFi EV Station Pro | `UC-EV-Station-Pro` |
| UniFi EV Station Lite | `UC-EV-Station-Lite` |

EV devices are also detected by the presence of `power_stats_single` in their `supportedActions`, so new EV models should work automatically.

Additional UniFi Connect devices may work but are untested. If you have a different device and it works (or doesn't), please [open an issue](https://github.com/danielsza/ha-unifi-connect/issues).
